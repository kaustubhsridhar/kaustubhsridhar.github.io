I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Enginnering</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Insup Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~weimerj/research.html">James Weimer</a>. 

My research interests span reinforcement learning (RL), learning for dynamics and control (L4DC), and robust deep learning with applications in cloud-computing, robotics, and cyber-physical systems.

I've interned at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/ai-services/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.argo.ai/">Argo AI</a> during my PhD. Before starting my PhD, I graduated with honors from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> and did an undergraduate internship at Duke University.
