<h1 id="hi">Hi, </h1>

I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Insup Lee</a>. I also closely collaborate with <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/">Dinesh Jayaraman</a>, <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~weimerj">James Weimer</a>, and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sokolsky/">Oleg Sokolsky</a>. 

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and sequential decision making.

Currently, I am excited about deep reinforcement and imitation learning, neurosymbolic generative models, and robust deep learning, with applications in robotics, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems (autonomous vehicles, electric grids, etc.), and operations research. 

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with honors from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> in 2019. 

My CV can be found <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
