<h1 id="hi">Hi, </h1>

I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Insup Lee</a>. I also closely collaborate with <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/">Dinesh Jayaraman</a>, <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~weimerj">James Weimer</a>, and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sokolsky/">Oleg Sokolsky</a>. 

My research interests are in in-context learning, deep reinforcement and imitation learning (particularly from large offline datasets), generative models, and robust deep learning.

My current aim is to create pretrained models for decision-making that generalize to out-of-distribution tasks and environments via in-context learning. I believe that semi-parametric methods (e.g., retrieval + transformers) will help achieve this goal.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with honors from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> in 2019. 

My CV can be found <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
