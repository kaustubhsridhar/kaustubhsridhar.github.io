<h1 id="hi">Kaustubh Sridhar</h1>

Hi there! I'm a research scientist at Google Deepmind working on general agents.

I defended my PhD student in <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Pennsylvania where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Insup Lee</a> and closely collaborated with <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/">Dinesh Jayaraman</a>. 

I am interested in creating adaptive generalist agents that are parameter- and sample-efficient, for the digital and physical worlds. Towards this goal, I have worked on generative models and in-context learning, deep reinforcement and imitation learning (particularly from large offline datasets), and robust deep learning.

My recent work on a [retrieval-augmented generalist agent](https://kaustubhsridhar.github.io/regent-research/) and [adding in-context adaptability to pre-trained VLAs](https://ricl-vla.github.io/) directly aims for this goal.

In the past, I have interned twice at [AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/ai-services/) and once at [Ford and VW's self-driving unit](https://www.argo.ai/).

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with honors from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>. 

My CV can be found <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
